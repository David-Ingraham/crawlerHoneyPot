Phase 1 — Hosting + Setup (Day 1)

Get a cheap VPS or a shared host (DigitalOcean, Vultr, Linode, whatever).

Install:

Nginx or Apache

Fail2Ban (optional)

A logging stack (see below)

Deploy a static site:

Plain HTML

No real content

NO references to yourself or any real PII

Goal: minimal human visibility, maximum bot visibility.

Phase 2 — Build the Bot-Attraction Layer (Day 1–2)

This is what pulls in bots. Tools, signatures, and files that are bot magnets.

1. Add fake CMS fingerprints

You don’t actually install WordPress — you just add files and metadata bots look for:

<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 6.3">


Create empty paths:

/wp-admin/

/wp-content/

/wp-includes/

/xmlrpc.php

Bots hammer these non-stop.

2. Add crawler bait paths

Static files only. Examples:

/admin

/login

/api/test

/feed.xml

/sitemap.xml (auto-generated with lots of fake URLs)

/robots.txt that allows everything

This guarantees scrapers show up.
3. Add a “large sitemap”

A static sitemap.xml with ~500–1000 fake pages:

/products/item1234
/users/verify?u=abc
/profile/1234


These pages don’t need to exist.

4. Add invisible keyword triggers

Hidden divs or footer text containing tokens like:

“email:”

“contact:”

“password=”

“api key”

“login”

“user:”


5. Add outbound links 

Bots follow links blindly.
Link to several:

random blogs

expired domains

RSS feeds

long-tail forums

This causes bots crawling those to also crawl you.



You’re building a bot observation station.
Not identity manipulation, not evasion — just safe analysis.

Monitoring must live on your server

Correct — you want:

low latency

full request logging

access to raw headers

no third-party analytics

Here’s a simple, safe architecture:

Blueprint: “Bot Monitor Stack”
Core Components

Nginx or Apache access logs
Capture raw:

IP

user-agent

request path

referrer

timestamps

A log parser + tagger
A small Python or Go script that:

tails the log

detects bot user-agents

fingerprints common bot categories

stores results in SQLite / JSON / Elasticsearch

Dashboards or alerts
Use:

Grafana (pretty dashboard)

Kibana (if using Elastic)

Or just tail scripts in terminal

Completely safe.

Categories your tool should detect
1. Search engine bots

Googlebot

Bingbot

DuckDuckGo

Yandex

2. SEO crawlers

AhrefsBot

SemrushBot

MJ12bot

Moz

ScreamingFrog

3. Security scanners

Nikto

Wapiti

sqlmap

Nessus

OpenVAS

ZAP

4. Generic scrapers

python-requests

curl

Go-http-client

Node fetch bots

Empty or spoofed UAs

Your tool can tag these based on:

UA patterns

request behavior

frequency

path targeting (e.g., probing /wp-admin/)

High-level Monitoring Workflow
1. Nginx logs everything
/var/log/nginx/access.log

2. Python/Go watcher script parses new entries

categorize user-agents

detect suspicious patterns

log events in your DB

3. Dashboard or CLI outputs trends

bots per hour

top paths hit

scanner activity

unclassified bots

crawl depth

 Metrics to Measure

Purely benign:

bot visit frequency

which bait paths are most popular

which bot types hit you most

referrer analysis

how fast bots appear after deployment

which sites seem to trigger scraper visits
